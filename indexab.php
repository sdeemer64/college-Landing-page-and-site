<p>Vatterott instructors know what it is like to work out in the field.
	</p>
	<p>At Vatterott College, we pride ourselves on identifying instructors who are able to relate the classroom material to experience in the real world. That is why we focus on hiring instructors who have had real-world experience working in the trades, medical, or technology fields. </p>

       <div class="testimonials_wrap">
       		<div class="testimonials_top">I just wanted to say it has been a great experience for me going to Vatterott College. It really helped me decide what career path I wanted. I liked the teachers and the staff. They were helpful every step of the way, especially in helping with questions about assignments and tutoring me through the hard part of college which was math. I liked the one-to-one way they teach and not just out of a textbook but with real life experiences. It will always, in my book, be the best college to learn new skills and point you in the right directions in a career choice.</div>
